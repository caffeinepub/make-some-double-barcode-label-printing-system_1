  "summary": "Diff implements independent per-event sound selection by adding persisted sound settings (success/error/printComplete) in the sound system and exposing UI in DiagnosticsTab under a new “Sounds” section. No explicit BuildRequest requirements were listed beyond the title goal; implementation appears aligned with constraints/non-goals.",

    {
      "description": "Added a global sound volume setting persisted alongside per-sound selections.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest asks for selecting each sound effect independently, but does not request a volume control.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/audio/soundSystem.ts (adds `volume: number`, default `volume: 70`, and checks `if (volume === 0) return`)",
        "frontend/src/tabs/DiagnosticsTab.tsx (imports Slider; sound configuration UI implied by diff and summaries)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added test-play functionality/UI for sounds (test buttons / play actions).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not request test buttons or a test-play API; it only requests independent selection.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/tabs/DiagnosticsTab.tsx (imports `Play` icon and `playTestSound` from soundSystem)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (DiagnosticsTab described as including “test buttons”)"

    },
    {
      "description": "Implemented multiple synthesized beep/chime patterns via Web Audio API as selectable options (e.g., beep1/beep2/chime/ding, error1/error2/buzz/alert).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not ask to add new sound options/patterns—only to allow independent selection per existing event type (success scan, error scan, print complete).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/audio/soundSystem.ts (adds multiple cases under `successSound`, `errorSound`, `printCompleteSound` using `playBeep`/`playBeepSequence`)"
